    <h3>Well Being</h3>

    <p>My passion is helping people to come to a state of balance through exercise,
        <br>and encourage practices like enough sleep, nutrition, meditation, 
        <br>therapy when needed, doing hobbies, and socializing.

    <p class="box1">Feeling productive is also a  <span class="box1">factor</span> in one's health. Making a career one that 
        <br>is fulfilling and fun can increase one's overall health too by lowering stress 
        <br> levels.
